# Tic-Toe-game-with-AI

Rules
1.The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. One player is 'X' and the other player is 'O'. Players take turns placing their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally,vertivally, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw

This version of the game is improved with support to play against an AI. The AI is coded with the help of the minimax algorithm, where there are 3 terminal cases: player 1 wins, player 2 wins, or a draw. The algorithm chooses the best possible way to continue based on the current state of the game, utilizing minimization and maximization. The game has a reset button accessible by pressing 'r'.
